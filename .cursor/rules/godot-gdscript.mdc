# Godot 4.6 GDScript 开发规范

编辑 `.gd` 脚本时须遵守以下通用约定。

## Core Development Guidelines

- Use strict typing in GDScript for better error detection and IDE support
- Implement `_ready()` and other lifecycle functions with explicit `super()` calls
- Use @onready annotations instead of direct node references in `_ready()`
- Prefer composition over inheritance where possible
- Use signals for loose coupling between nodes
- Follow Godot's node naming conventions (PascalCase for nodes, snake_case for methods)

## Code Style

- Use type hints for all variables and function parameters
- Document complex functions with docstrings
- Keep methods focused and under 30 lines when possible
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Group related properties and methods together

## Naming Conventions

- Files: Use snake_case for all filenames (e.g., player_character.gd, main_menu.tscn)
- Classes: Use PascalCase for custom class names with class_name (e.g., PlayerCharacter)
- Variables: Use snake_case for all variables including member variables (e.g., health_points)
- Constants: Use ALL_CAPS_SNAKE_CASE for constants (e.g., MAX_HEALTH)
- Functions: Use snake_case for all functions including lifecycle functions (e.g., move_player())
- Enums: Use PascalCase for enum type names and ALL_CAPS_SNAKE_CASE for enum values
- Nodes: Use PascalCase for node names in the scene tree (e.g., PlayerCharacter, MainCamera)
- Signals: Use snake_case in past tense to name events (e.g., health_depleted, enemy_defeated)

## Signal Best Practices

- Use clear, contextual signal names that describe their purpose (e.g., player_health_changed)
- Utilize typed signals to improve safety and IDE assistance (e.g., `signal item_collected(item_name: String)`)
- Connect signals in code for dynamic nodes, and in the editor for static relationships
- Avoid overusing signals - reserve them for important events, not frequent updates
- Pass only necessary data through signal arguments, avoiding entire node references when possible
- Use an autoload "EventBus" singleton for global signals that need to reach distant nodes
- Minimize signal bubbling through multiple parent nodes
- Always disconnect signals when nodes are freed to prevent memory leaks
- Document signals with comments explaining their purpose and parameters

## Error Handling

- Implement graceful fallbacks for missing resources
- Use assert() for development-time error checking
- Log errors appropriately in production builds
- Handle network errors gracefully in multiplayer games
